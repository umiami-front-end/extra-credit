## SVG & CSS

DUE: Monday, April 27, 2020, Noon.

~~A maximum of **fifteen (5) bonus points** can be earned.~~

(**Update (Apr. 26):** Error on my part because the above makes no sense! As noted below, one point per flag, so the max is six (6) points -- not 15!)

Points will be applied to the area of your grade which needs it most.


## Instructions

For this assignment, you will use SVG to draw the flags of five countries. Use CSS to apply the flag's colors.

Email Prof. Brown for your assigned flags. Prof. Brown will run a script which randomly chooses your flags from the [list]() included in this repository. As flags are claimed, they are removed from the list and marked as such.

Submit three (3) flags from tier I, two (2) from tier II and one (1) from tier III.

No assistance will be provided on this project.


## Conditions

The following conditions apply:

- Flags **must** reflect correct proportions and colors as specified on [flags.net](http://www.flags.net/).

- Make each flag at least 600 pixels wide.

- You may apply an `id` attribute to each `svg` element to identify the country, but you **may not** use `id` or `class` attributes for any elements within the `svg`.

  Example: `<svg id="united-states">...</svg>`

- Use an external style sheet to apply the colors for each flag. You may *only* use descendent, child, adjacent sibling, general sibling, pseudo-classes (i.e. `first-child`, `last-child`, etc.) or pseudo-elements as selectors.

- Included in this repository are assets -- `star.svg` and `crescent.svg`. You may use these if a flag you selected requires a five-pointed star and/or crescent. You may embed the code which defines the star and crecent in your HTML. Add these using `defs` or `symbol`. Another option is to use CSS positioning to overlay the star or crescent on the flag.

## Grading

One (1) point is earned for each flag which meets all the above conditions. Any deviation will not earn credit.

Projects submitted past the due date earn no credit.

Use of a vector graphic tool (i.e. Adobe Illustrator, Inkscape, etc.) to create any flags will be considered cheating.
